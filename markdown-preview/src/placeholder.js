var placeholder = `A Quick Introduction to Markdown with Marked.js
===

Create simple text with asterisks or underscores for *italics*, double  for __bold__, and triple to get ***both***!

You can make [links](https://marked.js.org/), and use 
> blockquotes
> for putting quotes in blocks!

# This is the largest heading
## This is the next largest heading
### And the next largest (you can have up to six pounds!)

---
### Coding

Use backticks to write \`<div></div>\` code, or triple backticks around multiple lines of code: 

\`\`\`
 function pseudoCode() {
   if (!backticks) {
     return trueCode;
   }
 }
\`\`\`

### Lists

Bulleted lists can be made with
* Asterisks
+ Plus signs
- And hyphens

And numbered lists can be made using
1.  Numbers in any order!
6.  Using 4 spaces will also indent any list item
    * So you can create nested lists
        + And nests within nests

---
Horizontal rules are also made with at least three hyphens, asterisks or underscores.

Images work similarly to [links](https://icons8.com/icon/19293/code), and just need an exclamation point in the front.
